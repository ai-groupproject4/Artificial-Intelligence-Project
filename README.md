# Malware Detection using ML and DL Algorithms.
CS-5233-001-Spring-2022-Artificial Intelligence.

This repository is the implementation code of 5 different ML and DL algorithms used to classify and detect malware using the KDD-CUP-99 Dataset.

Malware and cyber-attack detection are field that as we move into a much more virtually connected world will continue to increase in importance. With this increase in connection there is a need to understand and evaluate methods for processing and detecting traffic. Using the KDD-CUP-99 dataset which continues a combination of legitimate and malicious traffic, we were able to evaluate multiple deep learning and machine learning models to illustrate their effectiveness in classifying that traffic. The algorithms used to classify those attacks were Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM-RNN), Linear Regression (LR), and Deep Belief Network (DBN).
